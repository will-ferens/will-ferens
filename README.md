# Howdy!

I'm a Front End Engineer. Currently, I work at Searchspring where I help create amazing e-commerce experiences. Chances are, if you've bought clothing, outdoor gear, furniture, or even auto parts from an independent retailer - you may have used my code! I primarily have experience with JavaScript - React, Angular, and Node.js - but I've also used Java and Swift in the past.

You can learn more about me at my blog, www.will-ferens.com where I detail [personal projects](https://www.will-ferens.com/blog/creating-my-book-log) ✏️, learn about new tech 👾, and [review the books I've read](https://www.will-ferens.com/books) 📚.

When I'm not coding, reading, or writing, I love to ski ⛷, summit mountains 🏔, and travel 🌎.

Feel free to drop me a line at will.ferens@gmail.com ✌🏽!
